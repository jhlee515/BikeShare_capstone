# Capital BikeShare Capstone
This project is the final capstone project for my Data Science Career Track at Springboard. Other projects and assignments completed for Springboard can be found [here](https://github.com/jhlee515/Springboard).

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze Capital BikeShare's usage trends and forecast its ridership for 2021. This project uses Tableau and SARIMA forecasting for the main portion of the analyses. 

### Methods/Tools Used
* Tableau Visualizations
* SARIMA Forecasting
* GeoPy 
* Pandas/NumPy

## Project  Steps
1. [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/jhlee515/BikeShare_capstone/blob/master/1_datawrangling.ipynb)
2. [Pre-processing](https://github.com/jhlee515/BikeShare_capstone/blob/master/2_preprocessing.ipynb)
3. [Modeling](https://github.com/jhlee515/BikeShare_capstone/blob/master/3_modeling.ipynb)
4. [Reports/Powerpoints](https://github.com/jhlee515/BikeShare_capstone/tree/master/docs)

## Results
Since Capital BikeShare's inception in 2010, there has been an almost linear increase in usage, with peak ridership occurring in 2018. Ridership decreased significantly in 2020 due to COVID-19 and work from home regulations. Evidently, there is a clear element of seasonality in usage every year; ridership is low in the beginning of the year with peak ridership occurring during the summer time of the years and falling back down in the fall/winter times of every year.
